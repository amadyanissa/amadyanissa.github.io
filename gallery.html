                    <p>This one was a reminiscent of the time when I adopted my two pets, named Grisha and Oreo. Sadly, Oreo has passed away of sickness. We miss you already, Oreo :'( <br> Done with Paint tool Sai and Photoshop.</p>

                    <p>Throw back to the time when I, a special friend of mine, Grisha, Oreo, and two imaginary dogs (added just for the lulz) went on a walk to a garden in the middle of the town. The kids was surprisingly well behaved. <br> Done with Paint tool Sai and Photoshop.</p>
